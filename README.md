## Code Explanation for the Problem Statement
In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning solution that extracts product entity values (like weight, volume, and dimensions) from product images. The extracted values are crucial in digital marketplaces, especially when product descriptions are incomplete. The challenge is to predict the correct entity value for each image in the provided dataset. Below is an explanation of how my code addresses the problem statement:

# 1. Setup and Imports
The code begins by importing various libraries required for handling images, machine learning, and preprocessing. Key libraries include:

pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
cv2 (OpenCV) for image preprocessing.
torch and torchvision for handling transformations and pre-trained models (although not used in this iteration).
pandas, sklearn, and re for data handling, text processing, and regex operations.
# 2. Unit Mapping
The entity_unit_map and unit_normalization dictionaries define the allowed units for each entity type (e.g., weight in grams, dimensions in centimeters) and provide normalization for abbreviations like "cm" to "centimetre." These mappings ensure that only valid units are extracted from the images.

# 3. Image Downloading and Preprocessing
The download_image function downloads images from the URLs provided in the dataset and saves them to a temporary folder. The preprocess_image function applies grayscale conversion to the images to improve OCR accuracy by simplifying the image content before text extraction.

# 4. Text Extraction from Images
The core task of extracting text from images is performed by the extract_text_from_image function. It uses Tesseract OCR, which reads the text embedded within the image after preprocessing. The extracted text is then passed to further functions for unit extraction and matching.

# 5. Unit Normalization and Matching
The normalize_unit function uses regular expressions to extract numerical values and their associated units from the text. If the extracted unit matches an allowed unit (as defined in allowed_units), the value and unit are returned in a normalized form (e.g., "2.5 kg" â†’ "2.5 kilogram"). The match_units function checks if the extracted text contains valid entities and units, and if so, returns the normalized result. Otherwise, an empty string is returned.

# 6. Data Preparation
The prepare_data function processes the training data by downloading images, extracting text from them, and mapping each text to the target entity_value from the dataset. This data is used to train the model.

# 7. Model Training
The train_model function constructs a machine learning pipeline that includes a CountVectorizer (to convert the extracted text into numerical features) and LogisticRegression (a classification model to predict the correct entity value). It splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, trains the model, and reports the accuracy on the test set.

# 8. Generating Predictions
The generate_predictions function processes the test dataset, downloading images and extracting text as described previously. It then applies the trained model to predict the entity_value for each image and compares it against the allowed units for the respective entity_name. The results are stored in a CSV file following the required format.

# 9. Output Format
The output file contains two columns: index (from the test dataset) and prediction (the predicted entity value in the format value unit). If no valid entity is extracted, an empty string is returned.

# 10. Code Execution
Finally, the script is executed by calling:

train_model to train the model using the training data.
generate_predictions to predict entity values for the test dataset and save the results to a CSV file.
How the Code Aligns with the Problem Statement
Text Extraction: The use of pytesseract ensures text is accurately extracted from the provided product images.
Unit Matching: The mapping of allowed units ensures that the predicted values follow the problem constraints.
Model Training: A machine learning pipeline is used to predict the correct entity values based on the extracted text, ensuring generalization on unseen test data.
Output Formatting: The final predictions are formatted according to the required structure and saved to a CSV file that can be evaluated using the provided sanity checker.
The code, therefore, addresses the challenge of extracting and normalizing textual information from images to predict important product attributes in a structured and accurate manner.
